Package requirement:
To run this program, make sure you download Python and its library Selenium on your computer. You should also download
Firefox browser and Firefox gecko driver for Selenium.

Usage:
To run it, you must provide your logon id, password, the full department name, the course number, the lecture number(1,2,3...) and the grade type you want for that class. You can also set the frequency you want the program to check the website in seconds. You can leave the discussion section empty or provide discussion section number you want.(Must be in form like 1A,2B...). If you leave it as empty, the program would try to select any discussion section that has empty space. If you supply a discussion number, the program would ONLY look for that section even if there are free spaces in other sections.
